# GraftM

---

## Overview
Basically, GraftM is a pipeline used for identifying and classifying marker gene reads from metagenomic datasets. If you are after a tool that provide rapid and accurate analysis of short read sequence data, then you'll probably want to give GraftM a try

Because GraftM is still being actively developed backwards incompatability may happen in the future, although we will aim to minimise this as much as possible.

## Installation
Currently, GraftM has a few depedancies making installation a bit more difficult that simply using pip. We're currently working on a way to make installation of GraftM this as smooth as possible.
For now though, installation will have to be manual but very soon we hope to make this easier.
